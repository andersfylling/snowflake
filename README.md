> This lib supports signed numbers, but will convert them to uint64.

Does not hold functionality to connect a snowflake service, nor generating snowflakes. But rather parsing the snowflakes from JSON only. The default behaviour is to parse Discord snowflakes, but build constraints exists to handle twitter snowflakes as well. Note that there also exist `DateByEpoch` to which you can pass any desired epoch to affect the date parsing.

For module usage you must utilise the suffix found in the go.mod file (/v2 for v2.x.x releases, /v3 for v3.x.x releases, etc.).

Usage:
>Note: if you are against dot imports, which I can understand, instead of writing snowflake.Snowflake, you can write snowflake.ID. ID is just an alias for Snowflake.

```go
import . "github.com/andersfylling/snowflake/v5"

type DiscordRole struct {
    ID          Snowflake    `json:"id"`
    Name        string       `json:"name"`
    Managed     bool         `json:"managed"`
    Mentionable bool         `json:"mentionable"`
    Hoist       bool         `json:"hoist"`
    Color       int          `json:"color"`
    Position    int          `json:"position"`
    Permissions uint64       `json:"permissions"`
}
```

If you're creating an API that sends JSON, the snowflake will automatically be converted to/from a string for you.
